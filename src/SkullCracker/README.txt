We cannot guarantee code compatability or optimal rendering on all devices.  For our screenshots, development we used Processing 2.2.1, and HTC M8 HarmenKarden Edition phone running Adnroid 5.0.1. 

To Compile and Run:
Open Enorase/SkullCracker project with Processing 2.2.1 in android mode.  In the Processing window select Android->Sketch Permissions and Android Permissions Selector will pop up.  Make sure Internet permissions is enabled(the internet permissions box is checked).  Before running the program, we suggest you enable WIFI connection on your Android device as it will need to connect with our server to download client information.  Once you have a satisfactory connection to the internet on your device, click the play button (Run on Device) and allow Processing to begin running the program.  When the text in the debugging window displays: Running on Device... the screen on your android device will go black as it syncronizes with the server.  This may take a minute or two depending on your internet connection.  When the screen displays the View Patient and Settings buttons, you are ready to explore!  

To Resync client files with server:
Click Settings->Update.  Make sure your android device has a good internet connection before making this selection.  It should take a few minutes to retrieve all patient data.
